I first checked the files that are important for generating the attachment.xml file.
Then I checked the method by which we can generate the attachment.xml file.
excel --> JSON --> PDF
                   |
                metadata ( xml.xsd)
                   |
                attechment.xml


the data is incomplete so i checked the json data  why the XML file is showing incomplete data and tried to find the reason
Now I’m trying to fix the attachment.xml issue because it is not showing in the PDF A3 left panel as a link.
